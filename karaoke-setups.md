To run Karaoke from any portable speaker setup with an aux in, I highly recommend this wireless microphone setup which I use myself to run karaoke from 2 TWS Tribit Stormbox Blast. You can plug your music source directly into the included wireless receiver/mixer and you're all set. Having an onboard mixer is important as these speakers cannot play audio from 2 sources at the same time.
