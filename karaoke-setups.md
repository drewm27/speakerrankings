To run Karaoke from any portable speaker setup with an aux in, I highly recommend this wireless microphone setup which I use myself to run karaoke from 2 TWS Tribit Stormbox Blast. Plug the mixer's output into your speaker's aux in, and plug your music source into the mixer and you're all set. Having an mixer included in the microphone receiver is important as most of these speakers cannot play audio from 2 sources at the same time.
