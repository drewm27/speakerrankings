This page ranks 6 insane size powered Bluetooth speakers. The insane size powered Bluetooth speaker size is a dedicated party speaker. If you're looking at one of these, you have a very specific need for extremely deep bass and can accept that the speaker will be over 50lbs / 23kg. Most of these are a huge overkill for most applications. All speakers in this class have no batteries except the Sony and Teufel and need to be plugged into AC. The best here will have bass extension similar to a 12‚Äù woofer tower speaker.

To the average non-audiophile, generally speakers in the top 50% of this category will likely sound "good" to you. To the critical listener, generally speakers in the top 20% of this category will likely sound "good" to you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to pick one of those if you have budget, feature or aesthetic priorities. There‚Äôs a lot of good speakers out there.

Keep in mind these are designed more for deep bass than extreme loudness and if you're throwing parties for over 50 people you may want to look at real PA speakers instead, see [this](/portable-party-speakers/).
