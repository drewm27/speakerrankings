The OontZ Angle 3 is a budget-friendly Bluetooth speaker that has gained popularity for its affordability and compact design. However, before you hit the purchase button, it’s worth considering some potential drawbacks that might make you want to explore other options. Here’s a breakdown of reasons why the OontZ Angle 3 may not be the best choice for everyone:

### **Lack of Bass Depth**
While the OontZ Angle 3 delivers clear mids and highs, its bass performance leaves much to be desired. The small drivers in the speaker struggle to reproduce deep, punchy bass, which can be disappointing if you enjoy bass-heavy genres like hip-hop, EDM, or rock. For audiophiles or bass enthusiasts, this speaker may fall short of expectations.

### **Limited Volume Range**
Although the OontZ Angle 3 claims to offer high-quality sound, its maximum volume can feel underwhelming, particularly in outdoor settings or larger rooms. If you’re looking for a speaker to power your gatherings or fill a spacious area with sound, this model may not have the volume capacity you need.

### **Build Quality Concerns**
The OontZ Angle 3 is lightweight and portable, but its build quality can feel less robust compared to competitors in the same price range. While the speaker is marketed as water-resistant, its plastic casing may not withstand frequent drops or rough handling over time. Durability concerns can make it less appealing for outdoor enthusiasts or active users.

### **Average Battery Life**
The battery life of the OontZ Angle 3 is advertised at up to 14 hours of playback, but real-world performance often falls short, especially at higher volumes. Competing Bluetooth speakers in the same price bracket often offer longer-lasting batteries, making them more suitable for extended use.

### **Limited Features**
Unlike many modern Bluetooth speakers, the OontZ Angle 3 lacks advanced features like app support, customizable EQ settings, or multi-device pairing. For those who value additional functionality and customization, this speaker might feel outdated.

### **Mediocre Soundstage**
The OontZ Angle 3’s compact design limits its ability to create an immersive soundstage. If you’re looking for a speaker that delivers a dynamic and room-filling sound experience, this device’s performance may feel narrow and confined.

### **Conclusion: Consider Alternatives**
There's many other [inexpensive top ranked speakers](/top-recommended-inexpensive/) around like the $15 Onn Small Rugged, $50 Earfun Uboom L or $36 Miatone Boompro which will sound significantly better than the OontZ Angle 3.

Before buying, consider what features matter most to you and explore reviews of competing models to ensure you’re getting the best speaker for your needs.
