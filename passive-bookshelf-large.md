### #1 [GR-Research NX-Studio](https://gr-research.com/product/nx-studio-pair/): $3630 or $1100 for [the kit](https://gr-research.com/product/nx-studio/)
- Positives: Amazingly open sounding due to the semi open baffle Neo3 ribbon tweeter, will image better than any other bookshelf speaker. Neo3 ribbon tweeter is one of the best ribbons around for detail.
- Negatives: Bass will be very tight but won't be quite as deep as others due to the sealed woofer enclosure.
- Frequency Response: 70hz - 20khz (+-2dB)
- Dimensions: 18"H x 8.5"W x 15.5"D
- Weight: 20lbs / 9kg each
- Tweeter: GR-Research Neo3 Planar Magnetic Ribbon open baffle
- Woofer: GR-Research M165NQ 6.5" paper cone, non-resonant polymer frame, copper shorting rings and aluminum phase plug sealed enclosure

### #2 [KEF R3 Meta](https://www.amazon.com/KEF-R3-Meta-Walnut-Pair/dp/B0BV787HXY?mcid=6c9e467014c83b6fb999c3db97fb2494&hvocijid=6720613418737289195-B0BV75YT8L-&hvexpln=73&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6720613418737289195&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032161&hvtargid=pla-2281435177658&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkId=14edfc7eacd8537e279781d1a89309c8&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl): $2500
- Positives: Pretty smooth frequency response and the coaxial midrange/tweeter creates a near perfect off-axis response. One of the best coaxial speakers I've ever seen measured.
- Negatives: Slight 2dB frequency bump from 500-900hz, 2dB dip at 1khz, 2dB bump around 1.5-2khz. Some stored energy resonance in the waterfall plot around 900hz, 1.5khz and 2khz
- Midrange/Tweeter: 5" aluminum cone with 1" vented aluminium dome with MAT
- Woofer: 6.5" Hybrid aluminum ported

### #3 Wharfdale Diamond 9.1: $400
- Positives: The first design was a pretty good sounding speaker, the speaker was then [outsourced to China and lost 1.5kg and was made with cheap parts and sounds much worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/1e9k4jf/dont_buy_wharfedale_diamond_91_they_have_reduced/). Slightly rolled off in the treble by about 3dB
- Negatives: All current new ones sold today are the crap version.
- Weight: 12lbs / 5.5kg (good version), 10lbs / 4.5kg (bad version)
