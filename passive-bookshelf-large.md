### #9 Wharfdale Diamond 9.1: $400
- Positives: The first design was a pretty good sounding speaker, the speaker was then [outsourced to China and lost 1.5kg and was made with cheap parts and sounds much worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/1e9k4jf/dont_buy_wharfedale_diamond_91_they_have_reduced/). Slightly rolled off in the treble by about 3dB
- Negatives: All current new ones sold today are the crap version.
- Weight: 12lbs / 5.5kg (good version), 10lbs / 4.5kg (bad version)
