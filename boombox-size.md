title: Boombox Size Speakers
subtitle: Bluetooth Speaker Ranking
comments: true
---

A good size class of reasonably deep bass, compact size and reasonable weight. A truly portable party speaker that doesn't take up a huge amount of room. Most of these will fit in a big backpack. The best ones here are quite loud and have no problem shaking walls and floors at around 50% volume. The best here will have bass extension similar to a 8” woofer tower speaker. The only thing you're getting by stepping up to the Extreme size is more volume and very deep bass. IPX7 water resistant unless otherwise noted. All speakers in this class need AC to charge unless noted.


### #1 [Tribit Stormbox Blast](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Blast-Portable-Speaker/dp/B09PMYTJD2/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=ce0a6d06fae6af4067a3009be52cbfe5&camp=1789&creative=9325): $160 after coupon

- Positives: Amazing speaker given its size, competes well with some speakers in the Extreme size class, bass almost as deep as a Partybox 100. Quite neutral in the default and xbass modes, but try [Oluv's EQ](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/tribit-stormbox-blast-eqs-86777) or [Alan Ross's EQ](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn44K22IzqT/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) for a more neutral sound. 2 different light modes or can be turned off.
- Negatives: Lacks a bit of detail compared to the top ranked speakers in other size categories, dip at 5.5khz. Without the above EQ this speaker would rank around #4 in the rankings.

- Negatives: They pretty much lie about all their specs and sound horrible in all youtube sound samples. Only 50w (from their indigogo page), will never hit 120db at a reasonable measuring distance. Putting your db meter right against the speaker doesn't count, 1 meter distance is the standard. Barely any bass. Rattles at high volume. Uses external AC power brick to charge. Looking at it, it appears to be a generic car 2-way 6x9 speaker in a plastic box.
