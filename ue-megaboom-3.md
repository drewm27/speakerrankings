The UE Megaboom 3 is a premium portable Bluetooth speaker known for its rugged design and powerful sound. However, it’s not without its shortcomings. If you’re considering this speaker, it’s important to weigh its potential drawbacks against your needs. Here’s why the UE Megaboom 3 might not be the best choice for everyone.

### **Expensive for Its Features**
At its price point, the UE Megaboom 3 competes with other high-end Bluetooth speakers, but it doesn’t necessarily deliver features or performance that justify the cost. Many similarly priced alternatives offer more advanced technology, such as built-in smart assistants, customizable equalizer (EQ) settings via apps, or more robust connectivity options.

### **Bass Lacks Depth**
Despite its "Megaboom" name, the speaker’s bass performance doesn’t always live up to expectations. While it produces a decent low-end, it lacks the deep, resonant bass that audiophiles or fans of bass-heavy music might desire. Competitors like the [Earfun Uboom L, Soundcore Motion 300 or Soundcore Motion+](/top-recommended/) offer a more satisfying bass experience.

### **No Significant Sound Customization**
Although the UE Megaboom 3 comes with the Boom app for basic controls, the sound customization options are limited. For a speaker in its price range, users might expect a fully adjustable EQ or more detailed sound profiling, which could enhance the listening experience for various music genres.

### **No AUX Input**
The UE Megaboom 3 does not include a 3.5mm auxiliary (AUX) input, which limits connectivity options for devices that lack Bluetooth capabilities. For users who value versatility in how they connect their devices, this omission could be a dealbreaker.

### **Average Battery Life for Its Size**
While the UE Megaboom 3 boasts up to 20 hours of battery life, real-world use often yields less, especially at higher volumes. Competing models, such as the [Anker Soundcore Motion+](/top-recommended/), offer comparable or better battery performance at a similar or lower price point.

### **Limited Compatibility with Non-UE Devices**
The PartyUp feature, which allows pairing multiple UE speakers, is limited to UE-branded devices. This exclusivity can be frustrating if you own speakers from other brands and wish to create a multi-speaker setup.

### **Portability vs. Weight**
While the UE Megaboom 3 is marketed as portable, it’s relatively bulky and heavy compared to other speakers in its category. If you’re looking for a speaker to take on the go, smaller alternatives like the [Earfun Ubomo L](/top-recommended/) might be more convenient.

### **Lack of Significant Upgrades**
The UE Megaboom 3 doesn’t differ significantly from its predecessor, the Megaboom 2. If you already own the earlier model, upgrading to the Megaboom 3 might feel redundant as the changes are primarily cosmetic or minor feature enhancements.

### **Conclusion: Think Before You Buy**
The UE Megaboom 3 is a solid speaker with a loyal fan base, but it isn’t without flaws. Its high price, lack of advanced features, and limited bass response may lead some users to explore alternatives that deliver better value for money. Consider what matters most to you—whether it’s sound quality, portability, or advanced features—and compare the Megaboom 3 with other speakers like the [Earfun Uboom L, Soundcore Motion 300 or Soundcore Motion+](/top-recommended/) before making your final decision.
