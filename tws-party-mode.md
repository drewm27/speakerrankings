True Wireless Stereo (TWS) and party modes are popular features in Bluetooth speakers, enhancing audio experiences by enabling seamless stereo sound or multi-speaker connectivity. These technologies allow users to enjoy immersive soundscapes without the clutter of wires, making them ideal for home, outdoor, or party settings.

All speakers in the rankings are [labeled with the technology they support](/#all-portable-bluetooth-speakers-ranked). Search using ctl-f for "TWS: Yes" or "Party Mode: Yes" or the specific technology name to find them.

### True Wireless Stereo (TWS)

Almost all of the speakers can wirelessly stereo pair (referred to as TWS) with the same model speaker for 6db more output and wide stereo separation.

### Speakers That Remember Their Pairing

Earfun, Soundcore and Tribit speakers will remember their pairing after being turned off. JBL, Bose and Sony speakers will not remember their pairing after being turned off.

### Issues

Some of these multi speaker technologies may not work if you have a Bluetooth 4.x or less device like some laptops.
