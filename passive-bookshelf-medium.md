title: Medium Size Passive Bookshelf Speakers

This page ranks 14 medium size bookshelf speakers. The medium bookshelf class of speakers have woofers between 4" and 5.75". Bigger woofers will have deeper bass but the speaker will generally be bigger and heavier. Note these are ranked to my own preferences which is a flat frequency response, good directivity, reasonable dynamics, good imaging and detail. Others may prioritize these traits differently.

Keep in mind that the law of diminishing returns applies and the extremely expensive speakers at the top are really just a little better than the more reasonably priced ones. I would not hesitate to recommend any of the speakers in the top 80% of this page, just stay away from the ones near the bottom.

Consider this page to be a work in progress and more speakers will be added.
