This page ranks 2 medium size bookshelf speakers. The medium bookshelf class of speakers have woofers between 4" and 5.75". This size class will probably be the most ideal size for most people with a good balance between small size and reasonable bass output. Bigger woofers will have deeper bass but the speaker will generally be bigger and heavier.

Keep in mind that the law of diminishing returns applies and the extremely expensive speakers at the top are really just a little better than the more reasonably priced ones.

Consider this page to be a work in progress and more speakers will be added.
