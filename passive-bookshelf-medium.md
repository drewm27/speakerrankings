This page ranks 2 medium size bookshelf speakers. The medium bookshelf class of speakers have woofers between 4" and 5.75". This size class will probably be the most ideal size for most people with a good balance between small size and reasonable bass output. Bigger woofers will have deeper bass but the speaker will generally be bigger and heavier.

Consider this page to be a work in progress and more speakers will be added.
