subtitle: Bluetooth Speaker Ranking

One of the best general use size classes, 1L water bottle sized and light enough to hand carry, but with enough output for a small outdoor gathering. Small enough to usually fit in a water bottle holder and take with you anywhere. The best of these speakers will have no problem filling a reasonable sized room with sound. Outdoors they will sound a bit bass light but are fine for background music. The best here will have bass extension similar to a 5.25” woofer bookshelf speaker. Bigger speakers will generally have deeper bass. All speakers are IPX7 or better unless noted.

### #1 [Earfun Uboom L](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-EarFun-Portable-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0B1PJ5SQ7/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=6bd8a99706ada30aac69c16ed0df896c&camp=1789&creative=9325): $50 after coupon UBOOMLWC at Amazon

- Positives: The audiophile choice. Extremely neutral, possibly the best of any modern Bluetooth speaker slightly behind the Vifa Helsinki. This is the only speaker that sounds correct at every single volume level. Other speakers will need a different EQ at each volume level. Amazing sounding at low levels as it boosts bass and treble at low levels to account for the [equal-loudness contour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour). I recommend using firmware 0.4.3 which sounds the best and is what Oluv uses in his demos. All firmware files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fd2JKI4oB2o_WjnMy2c1Dw4WhsaJCh8G/view). Here's a [discussion of sound quality in each firmware version](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1136ghx/comment/j8tmwb0/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Check the current firmware version by turning it on, then pressing the power and Bluetooth buttons at the same time. You can flash any version up or down on it. To flash, turn the speaker off then hold down the Bluetooth button while plugging in the cable. To flash on a mac, [see these instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/17slpcs/guide_downgrading_earfun_uboom_l_to_oluvs/). In TWS mode, long press the outdoor button for 2 seconds to change TWS to Party mode. 
- Negatives: Seems to be shipping with 0.5.x firmware now which boosts bass, makes the lower midrange muddy and removes the low level volume steps. Will need to be downgraded to 0.4.3 for best sound quality. The only thing you lose by downgrading to 0.4.3 is the battery display on the phone, but there's still a battery meter on the device itself. The Uboom L would rank around 20th place with the 0.5.0 firmware. Latency is high (400ms) without turning on low latency mode (66ms) which doesn't work when two speakers are TWS paired. Low latency mode can be turned on by pressing the Bluetooth button twice. No app and no custom EQ. If having a custom EQ is more important than a neutral speaker, or if latency in TWS paired mode is a very important feature, like if you watch a lot of video, you may want to choose another speaker.

- Positives: Pretty deep bass for the small size. Pocket size in a big pocket. Can be used in stereo facing you, or omnidirectional lying down. Ability to have a custom EQ for each orientation, standing, lying flat, hanging. Try [the Uboom L EQs from Oluv for a more neutral sound](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/soundcore-motion-300-eq-settings-uboom-l-95778).
- Negatives: Without the above EQ, this speaker is pretty rolled off in the treble and will rank around #21 in the rankings. Bassup mode is worse than Signature. Not quite as detailed or neutral as higher ranked speakers. Slight bass distortion when turned up.

### #3 [Soundcore Motion+](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Bluetooth-Customizable-Waterproof/dp/B07P39MLKH/ref=sr_1_3?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=69752640fc8844e1034f29371a3bd3c4&camp=1789&creative=9325): $80 after $20 coupon

- Positives: The previous best sounding in class, still a great speaker with separate tweeters, more bass at full volume and better off-axis treble frequency response than the Uboom L. Just mediocre with the default EQ, I highly recommend using [this EQ setting](https://www.tumblr.com/techaudiophoto/706620138302144512/motion-hi-fi-eq) from [kai7895](https://www.reddit.com/user/kai7895) to get it more neutral. To achieve the absolute best sound you'll need the Wavelet app (Android only) and set the provided Wavelet EQ in there too. Turn off the wavelet EQ for outdoor use. An alternative is [Oluv's EQ](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgwSd6XBIv7UQK__LYN4AaABCQ) which only needs the Soundcore app EQ. Note these EQs only really sound perfect at a medium volume level.
- Negatives: Not quite as neutral or detailed as the Uboom L. Without the above EQ, this speaker will rank around #25 in the rankings.

- Negatives: Not stereo. Midrange and bass are weirdly recessed about 4db below 700hz. You need xbass mode for it to not sound like a clock radio with missing bass. You also can't turn up the bass enough in the custom EQ modes to get it neutral, so it will sound bass light. Firmware 1.2.3 fixes the distortion issues with xbass mode on, but bass still sounds wobbly and uncontrolled.
