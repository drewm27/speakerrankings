![Earfun Uboom L](/assets/img/ubooml.jpg)

This page ranks 117 small/medium size powered Bluetooth speakers. The small/medium size powered Bluetooth speaker size is one of the best general use size classes. 1L water bottle sized and light enough to hand carry, but with enough output to fill a bedroom or for a small outdoor gathering. Small enough to usually fit in a water bottle holder and take with you anywhere. The best of these speakers will have no problem filling a reasonable sized room with sound. Outdoors they will sound a bit bass light but are fine for background music. The best here will have bass extension similar to a 5.25” woofer bookshelf speaker. Bigger size class speakers will generally have deeper bass. All speakers are IPX7 or better unless noted.

To the average non-audiophile, generally speakers in the top 50% of this category will likely sound "good" to you. To the critical listener, generally speakers in the top 20% of this category will likely sound "good" to you. Don’t be afraid to pick one of those if you have budget, feature or aesthetic priorities. There’s a lot of good speakers out there.

### #1 [Earfun Uboom L](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-EarFun-Portable-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0B1PJ5SQ7/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=6bd8a99706ada30aac69c16ed0df896c&camp=1789&creative=9325): $50 after clipped coupon and coupon UBOOMLWC on the payment page

- Positives: Tuned by [Oluv](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsone/) and he knocked it out of the park. The audiophile choice. Extremely neutral, possibly the best of any modern Bluetooth speaker slightly behind the Vifa Helsinki. This is the only speaker that sounds correct at every volume level. Other speakers will need a different EQ at each volume level. For maximum volume without distortion use max volume - 1 step for most songs. Oluv left another higher volume for sounds that are quiet. Amazing sounding at low levels as it boosts bass and treble at low levels to account for the [equal-loudness contour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour). The speaker will need to be upgraded to [firmware 1.2.7](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jxg3eJFxHTtSu00NY3wqXOoDnMGqpO3c?usp=drive_link) to work with the app and set with Oluv's EQ in the Earfun app which sounds the best. The instructions say that you need a USB3 cable, but most USB2 cables work just fine, try the one included with your phone. Check the current firmware version by turning it on, then pressing the power and Bluetooth buttons at the same time. You can flash any version up or down on it. To flash, turn the speaker off then hold down the Bluetooth button while plugging in the cable. To flash on a mac, [see these instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/17slpcs/guide_downgrading_earfun_uboom_l_to_oluvs/). In TWS mode, long press the outdoor button for 2 seconds to change TWS to Party mode and back.
- Negatives: Seems to be shipping with 0.5.x firmware now which boosts bass, makes the lower midrange muddy and removes the low level volume steps. Will need to be upgraded to 1.2.7 with the Oluv EQ enabled in the Earfun app for best sound quality. The Uboom L would rank around 20th place with the 0.5.0 firmware. Latency is high (400ms) without turning on low latency mode (66ms) which doesn't work when two speakers are TWS paired. Low latency mode can be turned on by pressing the Bluetooth button twice. No app and no custom EQ. If having a custom EQ is more important than a neutral speaker, or if latency in TWS paired mode is a very important feature, like if you watch a lot of video, you may want to choose another speaker. The power button can sometimes get accidentally pressed when put in a bag.

- Positives: Pretty deep bass for the small size. Pocket size in a big pocket. Can be used in stereo facing you, or omnidirectional lying down. Ability to have a custom EQ for each orientation, standing, lying flat, hanging. Try [the Uboom L EQs from Oluv for a more neutral sound](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsone/shop/soundcore-motion-300-eq-settings-uboom-l-95778).
- Negatives: Without the above EQ or turning the top 2 treble EQ bars to max, this speaker is very rolled off in the treble and will rank around #50 in the rankings. Bassup mode is worse than Signature. Not quite as detailed or neutral as higher ranked speakers. Slight bass distortion when turned up.

- Positives: The previous best sounding in class, still a great speaker with separate tweeters, more bass at full volume and better off-axis treble frequency response than the Uboom L. Just okay with the default EQ, I highly recommend using [this EQ setting](https://www.tumblr.com/techaudiophoto/706620138302144512/motion-hi-fi-eq) from [r/kai7895](https://www.reddit.com/user/kai7895) to get it more neutral. To achieve the absolute best sound you'll need the Wavelet app (Android only) and set the provided Wavelet EQ in there too. Turn off the wavelet EQ for outdoor use. An alternative is [Oluv's EQ](https://ibb.co/XkfBtSS) which only needs the Soundcore app EQ. Note these EQs only really sound perfect at a medium volume level.
- Negatives: Not quite as neutral or detailed as the Uboom L. Without the above EQ, this speaker will rank around #25 in the rankings.

### #4 [Soundcore Boost “upgraded” 2021](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Soundcore-Well-Balanced-Waterproof-Customizable/dp/B01N4V4X5M/ref=sr_1_3?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=0134ddff40c01ca7040cef17bb8ce273&camp=1789&creative=9325): $60

- Positives: A very neutral good sounding inexpensive small speaker with quite deep bass for the size. This upgraded version has a usb-c port while the old one has micro usb.
- Negatives: Slight DSP tuning issue which makes bass get lighter at times at very low volumes, examples in oluv's video.

### #5 Denon Envaya DSB-250BT: $250

- Positives: One of the early Bluetooth speakers from 2017 with great sound quality. Very neutral, great soundstage.
- Negatives: Expensive. Treble is rolled off. Phantom battery drain issue, would not recommend these days. Uses some “stereo enhancement” reverb that can sound weird to some. Not as detailed as higher ranked speakers.

- Positives: A very neutral speaker, very small, almost pocket size, a huge sound quality leap over the Flip 5.

- Negatives: Not stereo. Midrange and bass are weirdly recessed about 4db below 700hz. You need xbass mode for it to not sound like a clock radio with missing bass. You also can't turn up the bass enough in the custom EQ modes to get it neutral, so it will sound bass light. Firmware 1.2.3 fixes the distortion issues with xbass mode on, but bass still sounds wobbly and uncontrolled.
