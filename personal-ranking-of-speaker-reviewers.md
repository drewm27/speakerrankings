My personal ranking of speaker reviewers and recordings, obviously this is quite subjective, but this is how much I trust their recording quality and their ability to rank neutral speakers properly.

I only use and link videos that either have useful well recorded sound samples or accurate comparisons of speakers against each other.

### #1 [oluvsgadgets](https://www.youtube.com/@oluvsgadgets) and [Oluv's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/posts)
- By far the most extremely accurate recordings. He is using a custom set of in ear microphones to do proper binaural recording and he hand tunes the recording EQ for the recordings to sound natural on neutral headphones. Oluv also has an extreme ability to rank speakers properly by neutrality. He’s a music producer by profession and knows what speakers should sound like. His recordings and recording equipment are all custom and tuned for the most neutral response I've heard from any video on Youtube.

### #2 [DSAUDIOreview](https://www.youtube.com/@DSAUDIOreview)
- My favorite reviewer of non battery bookshelf speakers. Excellent recording quality. They are using a pretty high end recording setup for all of these speakers. The YouTube comments also provide great analysis of the speaker's qualities.

### #3 [alanrossreviews](https://www.youtube.com/@alanrossreviews)
- Good recording quality, lots of speaker comparisons, a pretty good ability to properly rank speakers. He has some slight issues differentiating between boosted bass and deeper bass which is common among people who haven’t built up an extremely trained ear. He also prefers a slightly warm, not neutral sound and expresses that in many videos.

### #4 [M1MTechChannel](https://www.youtube.com/@M1MTechChannel)
- Good recording quality, good comparisons of a lot of bigger speakers. All videos in German.

### #5 [DLXWillington](https://www.youtube.com/@DLXWillington)
- Reasonable recordings, good picks of larger speakers

### #6 [Jagistreviews](https://www.youtube.com/@Jagistreviews)
- Reasonable recordings, good comparisons of a lot of speakers.

### #7 [techderaudios](https://www.youtube.com/@techderaudios)
- Reasonable recordings. Good comparisons of a lot of speakers.

### #8 [pickyaudio](https://www.youtube.com/@pickyaudio)
- Reasonable recordings. About the fairest reviews of speakers even with ones that are sponsored content. Was paid by Soundcore and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #9 [ELJefeReviews](https://www.youtube.com/@ELJefeReviews)
- Reasonable recordings. Was paid by Soundcore and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #10 [JaysStraightUpReviews](https://www.youtube.com/@JaysStraightUpReviews)
- Recordings done with a Sony Xperia I IV cell phone, not great audio quality, song choices do not show bass extension or clarity well. Decent picks of some larger speakers. Likely the most recent speaker releases of any reviewer.

### #11 [DannyPops](https://www.youtube.com/@DannyPops)
- Seems to be recording speakers off axis, always has the microphone above the speaker. Prefers speakers that are fun, rather than neutral. Likely paid heavily by Marshall

### #12 [CEONTHEMAKING](https://www.youtube.com/@CEONTHEMAKING)
- Pretty good recording quality, not a great judge of speakers and rarely ever compares them. Looks to be sponsored by Soundcore, likely paid by them. Was paid by Soundcore and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #13 [KULASTECHSHOW20](https://www.youtube.com/@KULASTECHSHOW20)
- Not great recording quality, the highs are pretty rolled off. Decent comparisons of speakers.

### #14 [storytripperhd](https://www.youtube.com/@storytripperhd)
- Not great recording quality, done with a cell phone

### #15 [GYMCADDY](https://www.youtube.com/@GYMCADDY)
- Not great recording quality. Mostly interested in bass. Was paid by Soundcore and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #16 [PAINFULLYHONESTTECH](https://www.youtube.com/@PAINFULLYHONESTTECH)
- Using a vocal microphone to do speaker recordings is a big nono, they do not have a neutral frequency response. Was seen in a Soundcore advertisement and is likely very biased and paid by Soundcore. Was paid by Soundcore and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.
