title: Personal Ranking of Speaker Reviewers
comments: true
---

This page ranks 31 online speaker reviewers. My personal ranking of speaker reviewers and recordings, obviously this is quite subjective, but this is how much I trust their recording quality and their ability to rank neutral speakers properly. As you can see from my comments, there's a lot of sponsored biased reviewers on the bottom. 

I only use and link videos that either have useful well recorded sound samples or accurate comparisons of speakers against each other.

### #1 [oluvsgadgets](https://www.youtube.com/@oluvsgadgets) and [Oluv's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/posts)
- By far the most extremely accurate recordings. He is using a custom set of in ear microphones to do proper binaural recording and he hand tunes the recording EQ for the recordings to sound natural on neutral headphones. Oluv also has an extreme ability to rank speakers properly by neutrality and has always given an unbiased review of good and bad speakers. His recordings and recording equipment are all custom and tuned for the most neutral response I've heard from any video on Youtube. One of the best creators of speaker EQs around.

### #2 [DSAUDIOreview](https://www.youtube.com/@DSAUDIOreview)
- My favorite reviewer of non battery bookshelf speakers. Excellent recording quality. They are using a pretty high end recording setup for all of these speakers. The YouTube comments also provide great analysis of the speaker's qualities.

### #3 [alanrossreviews](https://www.youtube.com/@alanrossreviews)
- Good recording quality, lots of speaker comparisons, a pretty good ability to properly rank speakers. Very unbiased. He has some slight issues differentiating between boosted bass and deeper bass which is common among people who haven’t built up an extremely trained ear. He also prefers a slightly warm, not neutral sound and expresses that in many videos.

### #4 [M1MTechChannel](https://www.youtube.com/@M1MTechChannel)
- Good recording quality, good comparisons of a lot of bigger speakers. All videos in German.

### #5 [DLXWillington](https://www.youtube.com/@DLXWillington)
- Reasonable recordings, good picks of larger speakers. Looks to have been sponsored by Soundcore for the Motion 300 and Motion X600 videos that he made as there are no comparisons and just push features. Appears to have moved on from speaker reviews to reviews of other tech products.

### #6 [JaysStraightUpReviews](https://www.youtube.com/@JaysStraightUpReviews)
- Recordings done with a Sony Xperia I IV cell phone, not great audio quality, song choices do not show bass extension or clarity well. Decent picks of some larger speakers. Likely the most recent speaker releases of any reviewer.

### #7 [Jagistreviews](https://www.youtube.com/@Jagistreviews)
- Reasonable recordings, good comparisons of a lot of speakers.

### #8 [techderaudios](https://www.youtube.com/@techderaudios)
- Reasonable recordings. Good comparisons of a lot of speakers.

### #9 [pickyaudio](https://www.youtube.com/@pickyaudio)
- Reasonable recordings. About the fairest reviews of speakers even with ones that are sponsored content. Was [paid by Soundcore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1d4nz4i/list_of_youtubers_paid_by_soundcore_to_use_their/) and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #10 [ELJefeReviews](https://www.youtube.com/@ELJefeReviews)
- Reasonable recordings. Was [paid by Soundcore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1d4nz4i/list_of_youtubers_paid_by_soundcore_to_use_their/) and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #11 [DannyPops](https://www.youtube.com/@DannyPops)
- Seems to be recording speakers off axis, always has the microphone above the speaker. Prefers speakers that are fun, rather than neutral. Likely paid heavily by Marshall. Appears to have moved on from speaker reviews to reviews of other tech products.

### #12 [CEONTHEMAKING](https://www.youtube.com/@CEONTHEMAKING)
- Pretty good recording quality, not a great judge of speakers and rarely ever compares them. Looks to be sponsored by Soundcore, likely paid by them. Was [paid by Soundcore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1d4nz4i/list_of_youtubers_paid_by_soundcore_to_use_their/) and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #13 [KULASTECHSHOW20](https://www.youtube.com/@KULASTECHSHOW20)
- Not great recording quality, the highs are pretty rolled off. Decent comparisons of speakers.

### #14 [storytripperhd](https://www.youtube.com/@storytripperhd)
- Not great recording quality, done with a cell phone

### #15 [Rtings.com](https://www.rtings.com/speaker/reviews/best/by-feature/bluetooth)
- A lot of problems with their measuring techniques. If you notice, below 150hz they have wavyness on all their speaker frequency response charts. This is due to them measuring all the room reflections, cancellations and room nulls. This is not the way you do frequency response measurements. Proper measurement requires an anechoic chamber or doing a gated time window so you capture the frequency response before the wall reflection arrives. Also frequencies below 200hz have to be [measured separately nearfield to each driver and port and summed together and spliced on to the midrange measurement](https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/measuring-bass-and-measurements-in-general.390274/post-7122541). Their max SPL numbers are all way off. They rate the 136w Boombox 3 as 91.9dB (Alan Ross says 111dB) and ~100w Sony SRS-XP500 at 92.6db which are both below the much smaller 30w Motion Boom at 93.1dB (Alan Ross says 104dB) which absolutely cannot be correct. Alan Ross’s numbers logically make more sense. Also they put a very heavy weight on if the speaker works with a voice assistant. 

### #16 [GYMCADDY](https://www.youtube.com/@GYMCADDY)
- Not great recording quality. Mostly interested in bass. Was [paid by Soundcore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1d4nz4i/list_of_youtubers_paid_by_soundcore_to_use_their/) and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #17 [PAINFULLYHONESTTECH](https://www.youtube.com/@PAINFULLYHONESTTECH)
- Using a vocal microphone to do speaker recordings is a big nono, they do not have a neutral frequency response. Was seen in a Soundcore advertisement and is likely very biased and [paid by Soundcore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1d4nz4i/list_of_youtubers_paid_by_soundcore_to_use_their/). Was paid by Soundcore and given a strict script to promote the Soundcore Boom 2 Plus and likely many other speakers.

### #20 [NewStuffTV1](https://www.youtube.com/@NewStuffTV1) and [NewStuffTV2](https://www.youtube.com/@NewStuffTV2)
- Not great recording quality, his microphone doesn't pick up any lower bass. Mostly interested in bass. Has been seen in Earfun and Soundcore advertisements on YouTube, likely paid by them. Appears to also be sponsored by Sony.
