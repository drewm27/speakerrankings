My personal ranking of speaker reviewers and recordings, obviously this is quite subjective, but this is how much I trust their recording quality and their ability to rank neutral speakers properly.

    - By far the most extremely accurate recordings. Oluv also has an extreme ability to rank speakers properly by neutrality. He’s a music producer by profession and knows what speakers should sound like. His recordings and recording equipment are all custom and tuned for the most neutral response I’ve heard from any video on Youtube.

    - Good recording quality, lots of speaker comparisons, a pretty good ability to properly rank speakers. He has some slight issues differentiating between boosted bass and deeper bass which is common among people who haven’t built up an extremely trained ear. He also prefers a slightly warm, not neutral sound and expresses that in many videos.

    - Recordings done with a Sony Xperia I IV cell phone, not great audio quality, song choices do not show bass extension or clarity well. Decent picks of some larger speakers. Likely the most recent speaker releases of any reviewer.

    - Seems to be recording speakers off axis, always has the microphone above the speaker. Prefers speakers that are fun, rather than neutral. Likely paid heavily by Marshall

    - Pretty good recording quality, not a great judge of speakers and rarely ever compares them. Looks to be sponsored by Soundcore, likely paid by them.

    - Using a vocal microphone to do speaker recordings is a big nono, they do not have a neutral frequency response. Was seen in a Soundcore advertisement and is likely very biased and paid by Soundcore.
