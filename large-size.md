title: Large Size Bluetooth Speakers
comments: true
---

This page ranks 64 large size powered Bluetooth speakers. The large size powered Bluetooth speaker size is a good balance between bigger travel size, small party size and reasonable weight. Pretty easy to fit 64 of them in a backpack with a little room to spare. Good enough to fill a living room and a good minimum size for listening to music outdoors with a group. The best here will have bass extension similar to a 6.5” woofer bookshelf speaker. Bigger size class speakers will generally have deeper bass. All of these are IPX7 or better unless noted. All use USB-C charging unless noted.

To the average non-audiophile, generally speakers in the top 50% of this category will likely sound "good" to you. To the critical listener, generally speakers in the top 20% of this category will likely sound "good" to you. Don’t be afraid to pick one of those if you have budget, feature or aesthetic priorities. There’s a lot of good speakers out there.

### #1 [Vifa Helsinki](https://www.amazon.com/Vifa-Helsinki-Bluetooth-Appearance-Hi-Resolution/dp/B0B182BGHS/ref=sr_1_3?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=49a541d7478a17863aff8efcc88396f7&camp=1789&creative=9325): $400

- Positives: Generally regarded as the best midrange and treble sound quality of any battery powered Bluetooth speaker.
- Negatives: No TWS pairing, looks like a purse, requires a hacked Vifa app ([Android only](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-125-11396.html) post #48) to enable night mode to sound good. Not sure I can recommend this one generally these days, the Uboom L has 98% of the sound quality with more features and a way cheaper price. There are mentions that the 2022 "new" version of this speaker doesn't sound as good as Vifa was purchased by a Chinese company and laid off all the great sound engineers in the Austria office.

- Negatives: Dip at 270hz. The Vifa Helsinki is cheaper and generally has a more neutral frequency response, I'd highly recommend getting one of those instead if you specifically want a Vifa. Not sure I can recommend this one generally these days, the Uboom L has 95% of the sound quality with more features and a way cheaper price.

### #6 [Mifa Wildbox](https://www.amazon.com/MIFA-WildBox-Bluetooth-Subwoofers-Waterproof/dp/B09P85X4VB/ref=sr_1_3_pp?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=85d9c4ac5c610819fe00ee1253367a3a&camp=1789&creative=9325): $100

- Positives: A really neutral frequency response across the midrange. Best in class bass extension. 6 different lighting modes, or turn off the lights with a long button press. You will need to upgrade it to the latest 2.11 [firmware](https://www.mifalife.net/en/service/support/product/WildBox) with a Windows PC, as it likely ships with 1.93. Sound quality and bass extension on previous firmwares wasn't very good. To upgrade firmware, install the PC flashing tool and download firmware. With the speaker off, hold V+ Play V- at the same time to enter flashing mode. To check firmware, turn on the speaker, quickly press the M button 3 times, then quickly press the Play button 3 times (it can take a few tries).
- Negatives: No app. The slightly boosted upper treble can be slightly fatiguing on-axis with certain songs. Some of the buttons can be confusing, “M” is the Bluetooth button and skip song is long press play, while repeat is double press play. The plastic case isn't textured or rubberized like other speakers and some may find it feels cheap. If [dropped it may break internally and sound strange](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/s/wD4DFAe3RX). I'd recommend only buying it from a place with free returns just in case it was damaged in shipping.
- Max Volume: 106db
- Bass Extension: 45hz (-10dB)

### #7 [Soundcore Boom 2](https://www.amazon.com/soundcore-Subwoofer-Waterproof-Floatable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CQ53RVTW/ref=sr_1_3?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f951314347e23bddd72378c50e4862fd&camp=1789&creative=9325): $130 or $104 on [Soundcore.com](https://soundcore.sjv.io/vNk6PW) with coupon SOUNDCORE2024

- Positives: Pretty deep bass for the size. Cool lights in the side passive radiators. For the best sound quality use [Oluv's EQ](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/anker-soundcore-boom-2-eq-settings-171292) or [Alan Ross's EQ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5EiGNSsR7C/?hl=en). With the stock tuning, this speaker would rank around #24, due to the boosted bass and rising treble.
- Negatives: Only a single midrange driver, so you only get stereo for the tweeters. Sound processing issues with inconsistent bass notes that disappear at low levels like the Soundcore Boom and Soundcore Boost, not great for listening at low levels. Quite bass heavy with BassUp turned on, I'd recommend turning it off. A little bit of a bright tuning in the treble, about +5db.

- Positives: Decently neutral speaker after EQ is applied. Slight DSP issue which makes bass get lighter at times at very low volumes. Try [Oluv's EQ](https://ibb.co/wNFwQ1h) for a more neutral sound.
- Negatives: Not as neutral or detailed as other top ranked speakers

- Positives: Firmware 4.2.9 is a big improvement in sound quality over previous releases. Try this [Oluv EQ for the best sound quality](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/soundcore-motion-x600-eq-settings-106961)
- Negatives: Stock frequency response is wavy. Use spatial mode for best sound quality. Need a different EQ for each volume step. Dip in the upper bass around 120hz. Rising frequency response, treble a little hot. Would be ranked around #20 without the Oluv EQ. Even with the Oluv EQ the bass isn't very deep and the sound is still a little unnatural.
