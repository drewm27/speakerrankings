A good balance between bigger travel size, small party size and reasonable weight. Pretty easy to fit 2 of them in a backpack with a little room to spare. A good minimum size for listening to music outdoors. The best here will have bass extension similar to a 6.5” woofer bookshelf speaker. Bigger speakers will generally have deeper bass. All of these are IPX7 or better unless noted. All use USB-C charging unless noted.

For longer runtime, check out a [power bank](/portable-power-stations/).

### #1 [Minirig mk4](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/bluetooth-minirig-4) with [subwoofer](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/minirig-subwoofer-3): $290

### #4 [Vifa Helsinki](https://www.amazon.com/Vifa-Helsinki-Bluetooth-Appearance-Hi-Resolution/dp/B0B182BGHS/ref=sr_1_3?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=49a541d7478a17863aff8efcc88396f7&camp=1789&creative=9325): $400

- Positives: Generally regarded as the best midrange and treble sound quality of any battery powered Bluetooth speaker.
- Negatives: Would be #1 if it wasn't for the following missing features: No TWS pairing, looks like a purse, requires a hacked Vifa app ([Android only](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-125-11396.html) post #48) to enable night mode to sound good. Not sure I can recommend this one generally these days, the Uboom L has 98% of the sound quality with more features and a way cheaper price.

### #5 [Mifa Wildbox](https://www.amazon.com/MIFA-WildBox-Bluetooth-Subwoofers-Waterproof/dp/B09P85X4VB/ref=sr_1_3_pp?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=85d9c4ac5c610819fe00ee1253367a3a&camp=1789&creative=9325): $100

- Positives: A really neutral frequency response across the midrange. Best in class bass extension. 6 different lighting modes, or turn off the lights with a long button press. You will need to upgrade it to the latest 2.11 [firmware](https://www.mifa.net/en/service/support/product/WildBox) with a Windows PC, as it likely ships with 1.93. Sound quality and bass extension on previous firmwares wasn't very good. To upgrade firmware, install the PC flashing tool and download firmware. With the speaker off, hold V+ Play V- at the same time to enter flashing mode. To check firmware, turn on the speaker, quickly press the M button 3 times, then quickly press the Play button 3 times (it can take a few tries).
- Negatives: No app. The slightly boosted upper treble can be slightly fatiguing on-axis with certain songs. Some of the buttons can be confusing, “M” is the Bluetooth button and skip song is long press play, while repeat is double press play. The plastic case isn't textured or rubberized like other speakers and some may find it feels cheap. If [dropped it may break internally and sound strange](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/s/wD4DFAe3RX). I'd recommend only buying it from a place with free returns just in case it was damaged in shipping.

### #6 [Soundcore Boom 2](https://www.amazon.com/soundcore-Subwoofer-Waterproof-Floatable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CQ53RVTW/ref=sr_1_3?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f951314347e23bddd72378c50e4862fd&camp=1789&creative=9325): $130

- Positives: Pretty deep bass for the size. Cool lights in the side passive radiators. For the best sound quality use [Oluv's EQ](https://www.patreon.com/posts/anker-soundcore-100643572). With the stock tuning, this speaker would rank around #24, due to the boosted bass and rising treble.
- Negatives: Only a single midrange driver, so you only get stereo for the tweeters. Sound processing issues at low levels similar to other Soundcore speakers, not great for critical listening at low levels. Quite bass heavy with BassUp turned on, I'd recommend turning it off.

- Positives: Firmware 4.2.9 is a big improvement in sound quality over previous releases. Try this [Oluv EQ for the best sound quality](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/soundcore-motion-x600-eq-settings-106961)
- Negatives: Stock frequency response is wavy. Use spatial mode for best sound quality. Need a different EQ for each volume step. Dip in the upper bass around 120hz. Rising frequency response, treble a little hot. Would be ranked around #20 without the Oluv EQ. Even with the Oluv EQ the bass isn't very deep and the sound is still a little unnatural.
