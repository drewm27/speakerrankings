### The Absolute Most Neutral TWS IEM Headphones

Due to the deep insertion of IEMs, there will be a resonance that is different for everyone that needs to be adjusted for in EQ that is based on the distance of the headphone to your eardrum as certain frequencies will resonate in that cavity and will need to be turned down. You can easily do a frequency sweep with the untuned IEM before you tune it to find this resonant frequency specific to you and apply the correct tuning.

[Oluv](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsone) has created a custom tune for the [$70 Earfun Free Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/Earbuds-Free-Pro-Cancelling-Bluetooth/dp/B09JWMJ7PW?crid=84UUFOP6Z6NG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.996ZyJEdQyoUw6wyxgj4G9c5MFIeGvkRRoW-2hTpHCJasSuhPK5VdbxN7pRA3XZ9_HeR2Ptfv4tvQeOkduLXLWuR93ncYxX7146x7eQ3exJSplmh2o7ZC9h4MbnrouUG4gs4aaYD1AkudjcOUzUUmjo7Lk09svVGGIDbU3WsmqLp5EWVTiVU75lFMKNwW98N8JXd8QctAv5X9R4CLIDZkBGTLg7jp5y9DxSSn4V8o18.wTVKY5zMG2Pim7iVBC-0VHsWOB2Kebr0J8rzb6LsD8I&dib_tag=se&keywords=earfun+free+pro+2&qid=1726036107&sprefix=earfun+free+pro+%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rankingspea01-20&linkId=07e39e6218331bf52b6057113edeefc6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) using a parametric EQ that's stored onboard the headphones. 

If you aren't interested in doing Oluv's tuning, I’d recommend something else from Scarbir's rankings below. The stock EQ on the Earfun Free Pro 2 is overly bass heavy which drowns out the midrange frequencies and will need tuning to sound their best.

His tuning is set directly on the earphones using the [Android only app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airoha.utapp.sdk) and only needs to be done once. After the EQ is set in the headphones you can use them on any device.

You’ll need to sign up for 1 month of his $11.50 a month Patreon to access the tuning EQ values.
