## Note

The mod of [r/Bluetooth_Speakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/) has decided to promote an AI generated affiliate link article about a few mediocre speakers and has deleted [this speaker ranking with over 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/z8bs6o/ranking_all_battery_powered_bluetooth_speakers/) from their sub. He’s also quite the [controversial person](https://www.reddit.com/r/WirelessSpeakers/comments/19d5c8t/posts_getting_deleted_in_bluetooth_speakers/), took over the sub by a r/redditrequest, promotes AI generated affiliate link sites all around reddit and doesn’t actually contribute any posts to his own sub. I don’t plan to contribute there anymore. Most of the knowledgeable people have moved over to [r/WirelessSpeakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/WirelessSpeakers/) which I moderate and recommend joining.

Thanks,

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

**Use ctl-f to search the document**.

The suggestions in this section are biased towards value speakers with a neutral frequency response. If you are after specific sound traits like bass boosted or warm speakers, skip this section and read the details in the main rankings.

My perfect minimal speaker setup would be **2** [**Earfun Uboom L**](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-EarFun-Portable-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0B1PJ5SQ7/ref=sr_1_3_pp?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspeake-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=433417fadb743aab2a7725af5f6ffde9&camp=1789&creative=9325) and **2** [**Tribit Stormbox Blast**](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Blast-Portable-Speaker/dp/B09PMYTJD2/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspeake-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=ce0a6d06fae6af4067a3009be52cbfe5&camp=1789&creative=9325), enough to cover the small and big use cases in a wide stereo setup. I believe these two are the best speakers for the money for nearly everyone.

The best small/medium size battery powered speaker with the best sound quality with modern features is the [**$50 (after coupon UBOOMLWC on Amazon) Uboom L**](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-EarFun-Portable-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0B1PJ5SQ7/ref=sr_1_3_pp?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=rankingspeake-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=433417fadb743aab2a7725af5f6ffde9&camp=1789&creative=9325) running [firmware 0.4.3](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1D66nAzbca9ZRyjxyLT2eIxJ142fzYEuL) (will need to be changed for the best sound quality and requires PC or [virtualization on a Mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/17slpcs/guide_downgrading_earfun_uboom_l_to_oluvs/)).

## Information about the rankings

**Note:** If you are not an audiophile or aren’t interested in speakers that can reproduce recordings and musical instruments to a high level of natural accuracy, then you may not agree with the ranking order in this document. Pop or EDM will generally sound fine with a lot of speakers. If you want to determine which speakers are truly great, use Jazz or Classical music and listen to how natural the instruments sound. If you are only interested in bass boosted, treble boosted, or warm speakers, please search the descriptions of speakers for that trait or look for the ones with an adjustable EQ.

To the average non-audiophile, generally speakers in the top 1/3 of each category will likely sound “good” to you. Don’t be afraid to pick one of those if you have budget or aesthetic priorities. There’s a lot of good speakers out there.

Feel free to post/send a link to this document for anyone or on any forum post you think could benefit from it!

This list is built from thousands of hours of video of the direct comparisons of speakers of trusted YouTube reviewers all spliced together into rankings by speaker size. It is ordered with the best speakers on top of each category with the selection criteria being natural/neutral sounding with reasonable bass extension and features. 80% of the speakers in this ranking have been ranked this way.

About 20% of the time when there are no direct comparisons, I’ve done my best to find the best sound samples, adjust for differences in microphone frequency responses and compare them myself using high end headphones (JDS 0L Dac, JDS 02 amp, Hifiman HE-560 or Earfun Free Pro 2 with Oluv’s Gadgets custom tuning) Although those 20% tend to be not very popular or high ranked and are generally insignificant.

Adjusting for microphone frequency response issues outside of well recorded audio like Oluv or Alan Ross is quite difficult. I first need a sound sample of a speaker I know extremely well and then compensate in my head for what the microphone is doing to frequency response based on what I know the speaker should sound like and then analyze the other speaker in question with that same frequency compensation. It’s not easy and it means a lot of videos I can’t use beyond just analyzing bass extension.

If you can’t find the speaker comparison you’re looking for, search Youtube for it.

Open rtings.com links in a new incognito window if you run out of free reviews.

All max volume measurements are at 1m, all bass extension measurements are at a -10db falloff and taken from frequency response charts and data from YouTube reviews and rtings. If you see a ~ that’s me estimating bass extension off the music because there’s no frequency response chart anywhere. Higher max volume and lower bass extension are better.

A huge thanks to all the Youtube speaker reviewers who have made it possible to even create this ranked list in the first place.

## Information applying to all speakers

None of these speakers will be as satisfying as high end home audio which when properly selected and set up can present a 3d sound image with depth, height and pinpoint location accuracy along with a neutral response and extended treble and bass. Enjoy these portable speakers for what they are, a way to enjoy music in any room or any place you bring them. For the closest to ultra high end audio, check out the Vifa Helsinki or a TWS pair of Earfun Uboom L in that order.

Almost all of the speakers can wirelessly stereo pair (referred to as TWS) with the same model speaker for 6db more output and wide stereo separation. Some can do non-stereo pairing with more than 2 speakers, JBL has [Connect+ or Partyboost](https://uk.jbl.com/blog/connect-jbl-speakers.html) (not directly compatible) up to 100 speakers, Sony has [Wireless PartyChain](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/MC000028) and [Party Connect](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/MC000028) (not directly compatible) up to 100 speakers, Soundcore has [Partycast](https://us.soundcore.com/pages/partycast) and [Partycast 2.0](https://support.soundcore.com/s/article/What-are-the-differences-between-Partycast-2-0-and-Partycast-1-0) (both compatible) up to 100 speakers, Bose has [Party mode](https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/support/articles/HC1597/productCodes/soundlink_color_ii/article.html), Mifa has PartyAdd up to 100 speakers, Ultimate Ears has [PartyUp](https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/features/party-up.html) up to 50 speakers, Marshall has Marshall Stack, and Samsung has [Giga Party](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00086422/) with up to 10 speakers. All speakers below are labeled with the technology they support, not all speakers support them. Note: Some of these multi speaker technologies may not work if you have a Bluetooth 4.x or less device like many laptops. Search using ctl-f for “Party Mode: Yes” or the specific technology name to find them.

If you want to stream Bluetooth to multiple brands or models of speakers you can use [TCL Super Bluetooth](https://www.androidcentral.com/tcl-20s-and-tcl-20-se-review) or [Samsung Dual Audio](https://www.samsung.com/latin_en/support/mobile-devices/how-can-i-use-dual-audio-to-share-media-on-multiple-devices/)

Latency only matters when DJing, playing first person shooter video games, or watching video. DJing or video games require latency below around 15ms (~1/100s), and watching video generally requires latency below 200ms (1/5s) for lip sync to be reasonable.  
<br/>Almost all these speakers start cutting out bass around 60-80% to get to their maximum volume without distortion. Bigger speakers generally have deeper bass, there’s no way around physics.

Battery life is generally rated at medium volume. Running at full volume, expect 25-33% (example: 10 hours drops to 2.5-3.3 hours) of rated battery life.

Iphones seem to be limited to [16 volume steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/cn904f/feature_the_volume_control_is_back_to_16_levels/) using the side buttons which is generally not enough. Click on the volume slider to access all 32 steps. Android has 24 volume steps which is better.

Some speakers from Soundcore, JBL, Ultimate Ears, and Minirig can disable their startup, pairing and shutdown sounds by changing a setting in their app.

Nearly all speakers can skip forward tracks by pressing play twice and skip back by pressing play 3 times. Certain speakers may use a different button press.

## Speaker Rankings

### Pocket size

The pocket size class is in a very specific class. These speakers should only be selected if you need something ultra small that can fit in a pocket, otherwise the larger classes will get louder, have deeper bass, stereo imaging, and generally better sound at the same price points. Bass will sound a bit slappy because these speakers can’t reach low enough for bass notes. All speakers in the pocket size are mono (single driver) and IPX7 or better unless noted.

### Small/Medium size

One of the best general use size classes, 1L water bottle sized and light enough to hand carry, but with enough output for a small outdoor gathering. Small enough to usually fit in a water bottle holder and take with you anywhere. The best of these speakers will have no problem filling a reasonable sized room with sound. Outdoors they will sound a bit bass light but are fine for background music. The best here will have a bass extension similar to a 5.25” woofer bookshelf speaker. Bigger speakers will generally have deeper bass. All speakers are IPX7 or better unless noted.

    1. Positives: The audiophile choice. Extremely neutral, possibly the best of any modern bluetooth speaker slightly behind the Vifa Helsinki. This is the only speaker that sounds correct at every single volume level. Other speakers will need a different EQ at each volume level. Amazing sounding at low levels as it boosts bass and treble at low levels to account for the [equal-loudness contour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour). Use [firmware 0.4.3](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1D66nAzbca9ZRyjxyLT2eIxJ142fzYEuL) which sounds the best and is what Oluv uses in his demos. There have been [noted issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1136ghx/comment/j8tmwb0/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with sound quality in almost all other firmware versions. Check the version by turning it on, then pressing the power and bluetooth buttons at the same time. You can flash any version up or down on it. To flash, turn the speaker off then hold down the Bluetooth button while plugging in the cable. Other firmware downloads [from oluv here](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxYqGOf02snlwIvY5yx-FQXwaQsjxBFyi3) or [from earfun here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MI5XiLReotmvD9N0kJKL_q--yb3REeFH). To flash on a mac, [see these instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/17slpcs/guide_downgrading_earfun_uboom_l_to_oluvs/). In TWS mode, long press the outdoor button for 2 seconds to change TWS to Party mode.
    2. Negatives: Seems to be shipping with 0.5.x firmware now which boosts bass, makes the lower midrange muddy and removes the low level volume steps. Will need to be downgraded to 0.4.3 for best sound quality. The only thing you lose by downgrading to 0.4.3 is the battery display on the phone, but there's still a battery meter on the device itself. The Uboom L would rank around 20th place with the 0.5.0 firmware. Latency is high (400ms) without turning on low latency mode (66ms) which doesn’t work when two speakers are TWS paired. Low latency mode can be turned on by pressing the Bluetooth button twice. No app and no custom EQ. If having a custom EQ is more important than a neutral speaker, or if latency in TWS paired mode is a very important feature, like if you watch a lot of video, you may want to choose another speaker.

    1. Positives: Pretty deep bass for the small size. Pocket size in a big pocket. Can be used in stereo facing you, or omnidirectional lying down. Ability to have a custom EQ for each orientation, standing, lying flat, hanging. Try [the Uboom L EQs from Oluv for a more neutral sound](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/soundcore-motion-300-eq-settings-uboom-l-95778).
    2. Negatives: Without the above EQ, this speaker is pretty rolled off in the treble and will rank around #21 in the rankings. Bassup mode is worse than Signature. Not quite as detailed or neutral as higher ranked speakers. Slight bass distortion when turned up.

    1. Positives: The previous best sounding in class, still a great speaker with separate tweeters, more bass at full volume and better off-axis treble frequency response than the Uboom L. Just mediocre with the default EQ, I highly recommend using [this EQ setting](https://www.tumblr.com/techaudiophoto/706620138302144512/motion-hi-fi-eq) from [kai7895](https://www.reddit.com/user/kai7895) to get it more neutral. To achieve the absolute best sound you’ll need the Wavelet app (Android only) and set the provided Wavelet EQ in there too. Turn off the wavelet EQ for outdoor use. An alternative is [Oluv’s EQ](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgwSd6XBIv7UQK__LYN4AaABCQ) which only needs the Soundcore app EQ. Note these EQs only really sound perfect at a medium volume level.
    2. Negatives: Not quite as neutral or detailed as the Uboom L. Without the above EQ, this speaker will rank around #25 in the rankings.

    1. Positives: A very neutral good sounding inexpensive small speaker with quite deep bass for the size. This upgraded version has a usb-c port while the old one has micro usb.

    1. Negatives: Not stereo. Midrange and bass are weirdly recessed about 4db below 700hz. You need xbass mode for it to not sound like a clock radio with missing bass. You also can't turn up the bass enough in the custom EQ modes to get it neutral, so it will sound bass light. Firmware 1.2.3 fixes the distortion issues with xbass mode on, but bass still sounds wobbly and uncontrolled.

### Large size

A good balance between bigger travel size, small party size and reasonable weight. Pretty easy to fit 2 of them in a backpack with a little room to spare. A good minimum size for listening to music outdoors. The best here will have a bass extension similar to a 6.5” woofer bookshelf speaker. Bigger speakers will generally have deeper bass. All of these are IPX7 or better unless noted. All use USB-C charging unless noted.

    1. Positives: A really neutral frequency response across the midrange. Best in class bass extension. 6 different lighting modes, or turn off the lights with a long button press. You will need to upgrade it to the latest 2.11 [firmware](https://www.mifa.net/en/service/support/product/WildBox) with a Windows PC, as it likely ships with 1.93. Sound quality and bass extension on previous firmwares wasn’t very good. To upgrade firmware, install the PC flashing tool and download firmware. With the speaker off, hold V+ Play V- at the same time to enter flashing mode. To check firmware, turn on the speaker, quickly press the M button 3 times, then quickly press the Play button 3 times (it can take a few tries).
    2. Negatives: No app. The slightly boosted upper treble can be slightly fatiguing on-axis with certain songs. Some of the buttons can be confusing, “M” is the bluetooth button and skip song is long press play, while repeat is double press play. The plastic case isn’t textured or rubberized like other speakers and some may find it feels cheap. If [dropped it may break internally and sound strange](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/s/wD4DFAe3RX). I'd recommend only buying it from a place with free returns just in case it was damaged in shipping.

    1. Positives: Firmware 4.2.9 is a big improvement in sound quality over previous releases. Try this [Oluv EQ for the best sound quality](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/soundcore-motion-x600-eq-settings-106961)
    2. Negatives: Stock frequency response is wavy. Use spatial mode for best sound quality. Need a different EQ for each volume step. Dip in the upper bass around 120hz. Rising frequency response, treble a little hot. Would be ranked around #20 without the Oluv EQ. Even with the Oluv EQ the bass isn’t very deep and the sound is still a little unnatural.

### Boombox size

A good size class of reasonably deep bass, compact size and reasonable weight. A truly portable party speaker that doesn’t take up a huge amount of room. Most of these will fit in a big backpack. The best ones here are quite loud and have no problem shaking walls and floors at around 50% volume. The best here will have a bass extension similar to a 8” woofer tower speaker. The only thing you’re getting by stepping up to the Extreme size is more volume and very deep bass. IPX7 water resistant unless otherwise noted. All speakers in this class need AC to charge unless noted.

    1. Positives: Amazing speaker given its size, competes well with some speakers in the Extreme size class, bass almost as deep as a Partybox 100. Quite neutral in the default and xbass modes, but try [Oluv’s EQ](https://www.patreon.com/oluvsgadgets/shop/tribit-stormbox-blast-eqs-86777) or [Alan Ross’s EQ](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn44K22IzqT/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) for a more neutral sound. 2 different light modes or can be turned off.
    2. Negatives: Lacks a bit of detail compared to the top ranked speakers in other size categories, dip at 5.5khz. Without the above EQ this speaker would rank around #4 in the rankings.

    1. Negatives: They pretty much lie about all their specs and sound horrible in all youtube sound samples. Only 50w (from their indigogo page), will never hit 120db at a reasonable measuring distance. Putting your db meter right against the speaker doesn’t count, 1 meter distance is the standard. Barely any bass. Rattles at high volume. Uses external AC power brick to charge. Looking at it, it appears to be a generic car 2-way 6x9 speaker in a plastic box.

### Extreme size

If you’re looking at one of these, you have a very specific need for very deep bass or extreme loudness and can accept that the speaker may be very large and heavy. Most of these are a huge overkill for most applications and the Boombox size is better for most people. Most of these speakers are at least IPX4 unless noted. All speakers in this class need AC to charge. The best here will have a bass extension similar to a 10” woofer tower speaker.

If you need a speaker for parties over 50 people you may want to look at real PA speakers instead like the QSC K12.2, EV EKX-12P, or for cheaper options the Yamaha DBR12 or EV ZLX12, possibly with 18” subs if you need bass deeper than 50hz, see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WirelessSpeakers/comments/18tfi5l/portable_speakers_for_parties_over_50_people/).

## Issues I’m working on

It’s getting really hard to slot speakers in, comparing 97+ small/medium speakers against each other in my head is not easy. I’d say the best of them are ranked properly, but when you get near the middle of the rankings, it gets really difficult to rank them against each other, so they could all be a little off and preference comes into play.

At this point I’m throwing out the rtings.com numbers, they rate the 136w Boombox 3 as 91.9db (alan ross says 111db) and ~100w Sony SRS-XP500 at 92.6db which are both below the much smaller 30w Motion Boom at 93.1db (alan ross says 104db) which absolutely cannot be correct. Alan Ross’s numbers logically make more sense. Right now there’s a mix of both with most speakers boombox size and below using Alan’s measurement and most bigger ones using rtings.com.

Rtings.com also has big issues with their frequency response charts. Below 150hz you can see they go all wavy for every single speaker. That is due to standing waves in the room and is not a measurement of the speaker itself, so I don’t think any of their measurements are accurate in any way and will be minimizing their data in the rankings.

## Work currently in progress

Adding all details about each speaker like TWS, Party mode, IP rating, microphone.

## Personal ranking of speaker reviewers

My personal ranking of speaker reviewers and recordings, obviously this is quite subjective, but this is how much I trust their recording quality and their ability to rank neutral speakers properly.  

1. <https://www.youtube.com/c/oluvsgadgets>
    1. By far the most extremely accurate recordings. Oluv also has an extreme ability to rank speakers properly by neutrality. He’s a music producer by profession and knows what speakers should sound like. His recordings and recording equipment are all custom and tuned for the most neutral response I’ve heard from any video on Youtube.
2. <https://www.youtube.com/c/alanrossreviews>
    1. Good recording quality, lots of speaker comparisons, a pretty good ability to properly rank speakers. He has some slight issues differentiating between boosted bass and deeper bass which is common among people who haven’t built up an extremely trained ear. He also prefers a slightly warm, not neutral sound and expresses that in many videos.
3. <https://www.youtube.com/@M1MTechChannel>
    1. Good recording quality
4. <https://www.youtube.com/@DLXWillington>
    1. Reasonable recordings, good picks of larger speakers
5. <https://www.youtube.com/@techderaudios>
    1. Reasonable recordings
6. <https://www.youtube.com/@KULASTECHSHOW20>
    1. Reasonable recordings
7. <https://www.youtube.com/@JaysStraightUpReviews>
    1. Recordings done with a cell phone, not very good song choice. Decent picks of some larger speakers. Likely the most recent speaker releases of any reviewer.
8. <https://www.youtube.com/@DannyPops>
    1. Seems to be recording speakers off axis, always has the microphone above the speaker. Prefers speakers that are fun, rather than neutral. Likely paid heavily by Marshall
9. <https://www.youtube.com/@storytripperhd>
    1. Not great recording quality, done with a cell phone
10. <https://www.youtube.com/@GYMCADDY>
    1. Not great recording quality, mostly interested in bass
11. <https://www.youtube.com/@NewStuffTV1>
    1. Not great recording quality, mostly interested in bass. Has been seen in Soundcore advertisements, likely paid off.
12. <https://www.youtube.com/@FlossyCarter>
    1. Recording quality isn’t very good, mostly interested in bass
13. <https://www.youtube.com/@KosherTech>
    1. Pretty close to completely useless, his microphone doesn’t pick up any bass at all
